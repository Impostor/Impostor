Impostor-Staging is a development fork of Impostor, aimed to improve development velocity.

Impostor is the only actively maintained **Among Us** private server implementation. This allows you to play a game when the official servers are unavailable or when their anticheat blocks the mod you want to play with

As Among Us is actively updated, please double check which version of Among Us your version of Impostor-Staging supports. If the latest release doesn't support your version, you may want to use the latest build from the dev branch if you want to play on the latest version of Among Us that supported by Impostor.

If you want to play on an older version of Among Us, you can download old releases from [here](https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor/releases/), however these versions are less supported.

## Features

- All Among Us features are implemented except Cosmicube point generation.
- Plugin support.
- Server-sided anticheat.

## Installation

### Client

If you just want to play on a server hosted by someone else, you need to configure your client to connect to an Impostor server. Please go to [this website](https://impostor.github.io/Impostor) to set up your client by following the instructions for your OS there.

### Server

See the [docs](docs/Running-the-server.md) for instructions on how to set it up.

## Troubleshooting

See [TROUBLESHOOTING](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) to solve issues with the Impostor client or the server.
