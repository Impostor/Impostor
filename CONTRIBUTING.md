# Contribute guidelines

We are always looking for people to help improve Impostor.

## Code

- If you are implementing or fixing an issue, please comment on the issue so work is not duplicated.
- If you want to implementing a new feature, create an issue first describing the issue so we know about it. We are always open for discussion or questions on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Mk3w6Tb).
- Don't commit unnecessary changes to the codebase or debugging code.
- Write meaningful commits or squash them.
- Please try to follow the code style of the rest of the codebase. An `.editorconfig` file has been provided to keep consistency.
- Stylecop is also enabled: please make sure your PR compiles without warnings.

## Pull requests

- Only make pull requests to the `dev` branch.
- Only implement one feature per pull request to keep it easy to understand.
- Expect comments or questions on your pull request from the project maintainers. We try to keep the code as consistent and maintainable as possible.
- Each pull request should come from a new branch in your fork, it should have a meaningful name.
- We try to respond to pull requests as fast as possible. If you think we might have missed it, let us know on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Mk3w6Tb).

If you have any questions, let us know.
