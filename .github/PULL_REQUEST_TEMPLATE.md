### Description

<!--
Explain why you made these changes and the problem they're solving.
-->

### Test Plan

<!--
How should we test your PR? This section is mandatory.
Here are some examples:

If you're adding a piece of API:
> I added an example [fill me in] to Impostor.Api.Example

If you're fixing a bug, add a reproduction case:
> Add 4 players to a room
> Start a game
> Player 1 (which is (not) the host) does X
> Player 2 does Y
> Expected behaviour: Player X gets kicked for cheating
> Actual behaviour: Z happens
Linking to a bug with a reproduction case is also sufficient.
