# Running the server

There are currently two modes to run the Impostor server. The first way, Single Server, is the simplest one, can handle up to a few hundred simultaneous players, and is the one you should probably use. Multi-Server mode will distribute players across other servers and is intended for advanced users.

## Single server

### Without Docker

1. Install the [.NET 6.0 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/6.0). Installing the SDK also works, but is not necessary unless you plan on developing Impostor or Impostor plugins. If you're asked to pick between a console, desktop or server runtime, the console runtime is enough.
2. Find the [latest release](https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor/releases) or the [latest CI build](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Impostor/Impostor/branch/master/artifacts).
3. Download the version for your OS (linux/win/osx). Impostor is built for multiple CPU-architectures, you most likely want the x64 version, unless you are running on a Raspberry Pi or another device with an ARM processor.
4. Extract the zip.
5. Modify `config.json` to your liking. Documentation can be found [here](Server-configuration.md) _(this step is mandatory if you want to expose this server to other devices)_
6. Run `Impostor.Server` (Linux/macOS) or `Impostor.Server.exe` (Windows)

### Using Docker

[![Docker Image](https://img.shields.io/docker/v/aeonlucid/impostor/nightly)](https://hub.docker.com/r/aeonlucid/impostor)

After installing Docker, you can just start a Docker container with `docker run`:

```
docker run -p 22023:22023/udp aeonlucid/impostor:nightly
```

### Using Docker Compose

```
version: '3.4'

services:
  impostor:
    image: aeonlucid/impostor:nightly
    container_name: impostor
    ports:
      - 22023:22023/udp
    volumes:
      - /path/to/local/config.json:/app/config.json # For easy editing of the config
      - /path/to/local/plugins:/app/plugins         # Only needed if using plugins
      - /path/to/local/libraries:/app/libraries     # Only needed if using external libraries
```

## Multiple servers

Follow the steps from the single server on two or more servers. You should only need to set this up if you have a very large server and can no longer fit everyone on one server: if this is your first time installing Impostor, use a single server.

### Master server

The master server will accept client connections and redirect them to the other servers listed in the configuration. It will not host any games itself.

Example configuration:

```json
{
  "Server": {
    "PublicIp": "127.0.0.1",
    "PublicPort": 22023,
    "ListenIp": "0.0.0.0",
    "ListenPort": 22023
  },
  "ServerRedirector": {
    "Enabled": true,
    "Master": true,
    "Locator": {
      "Redis": "",
      "UdpMasterEndpoint": "127.0.0.1:22024"
    },
    "Nodes": [
      {
        "Ip": "127.0.0.1",
        "Port": 22025
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Node servers

The node server should have `ServerRedirector` enabled too, but `Master` **must be disabled**. Nodes do not need to be aware of each other.

Example configuration:

```json
{
  "Server": {
    "PublicIp": "127.0.0.1",
    "PublicPort": 22025,
    "ListenIp": "0.0.0.0",
    "ListenPort": 22025
  },
  "ServerRedirector": {
    "Enabled": true,
    "Master": false,
    "Locator": {
      "Redis": "",
      "UdpMasterEndpoint": "127.0.0.1:22024"
    }
  }
}
```
