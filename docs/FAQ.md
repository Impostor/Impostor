# Frequently Answered Questions

## What is this?

The Impostor project is a reverse engineered and open source server for the game Among Us. The game itself is developed by [Innersloth](http://www.innersloth.com/) while this project is maintained by the community. This project was built out of frustration for the lack of server availability in certain regions and the inability for the core developer, [AeonLucid](https://github.com/AeonLucid), to join a public game. It has not been officially endorsed by the studio, although changes to the client have been made to make installing custom regions easier.

## Can this be used with the mobile version of the game?

Yes, Impostor can be used with both the Android and iOS versions of the game. You can add a custom server via a link, you can do this using the [site](https://impostor.github.io/Impostor)

## Can this be used with the console version of the game?

Unfortunately not due to limitations on the side of the console makers. We cannot support the DTLS encryption required as we don't have Innersloth's private key.

## Can this be used with Among Us VR or Among Us 3D

Sadly not, as they use an entirely different network library it's not possible to support both versions.

As of writing we're not aware of projects that implement a custom server for AUVR/AU3D.

## How can I get started?

See [Setting up your Server](Running-the-server.md) for more information on running the server and [Client Setup](https://impostor.github.io/Impostor/) for helping your friends join in!

If you're having issues with the server software, check the [Troubleshooting page](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).
