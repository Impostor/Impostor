# Reporting Security Issues

The Impostor-Staging team takes security seriously. If you find a 
security related issue, please don't disclose it in a GitHub issue or in our
Discord, but rather disclose it privately to the maintainers, so we can fix it
in a way that end-users are the least affected. 

Note that issues affecting availability are also in scope. This includes issues
where players are kicked because of actions of other players or the server 
becomes unavailable for new players to join or create games.

You can report issues to the following maintainers:

- miniduikboot: mini@duikbo.at

We aim to resolve security issues within 90 days of reporting.
