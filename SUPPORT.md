# Getting Support for Impostor-Staging

Before opening a support ticket, please check the project documentation to see
if your problem is already addressed. 

We offer support for Impostor in the Impostor discord. We recommend against 
using GitHub Issues for tech support problems: due to the email-like nature of
GitHub we see that the turnaround time for tech support tickets is much higher.

If you make a support ticket, please include the following:

- Your version of Impostor
- Which OS you're running Impostor on (Windows, Linux)
- How did you install Impostor (Standalone, Docker, Pterodactyl)
- Your version of Among Us
- Whether you are using any client-side mods

If you're trying to connect to a brand new Impostor server, please also include the
following:

- Where are you hosting your server (At home, at a cloud provider)
- If you're using a cloud provider, please also include their name
- If you're hosting from home, please include the brand of your router (ASUS routers are known to be problematic)
- If you're hosting from home, please also include if you're able to connect to your server if can connect to your server when running on `localhost`

# Support for old versions of Impostor-Staging

Due to time constraints on the side of the developers, we only support a
limited amount of old Impostor versions:

| Version | Supported until | Extent of support              |
|---------|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| v1.10.x | 2026-?-?        | Features and bugfixes.         |
| v1.9.x  | 2025-06-18      | Important security fixes only. |

Older versions are not supported by the Impostor maintainers.

We also offer support for the last commit of the `stable` and `dev` branches.

Builds from pull requests are generally not supported, as they represent work
that's still in progress.
